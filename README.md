This repository demonstrates a common error in Kotlin related to the immutability of lists. The `bug.kt` file showcases the issue where attempting to modify an immutable list results in unexpected behavior.  The `bugSolution.kt` file provides a corrected version using a mutable list when modifications are needed.  Understanding the distinction between immutable and mutable lists is crucial in avoiding common Kotlin programming errors.
